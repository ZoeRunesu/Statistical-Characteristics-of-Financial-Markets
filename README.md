# Statistical-Characteristics-of-Financial-Markets
WorldQuant University Capstone

Financial market is always changing and influenced by many micro and macro-economic factors. We have numerous methods to understand and analyse the market. These methods help us understand how the market is changing due to the influence of the micro and macro-economic factors. In some cases, we will identify the factors that effect the market and analyse. So, we need to continuously monitor the market for any changes, keep reassessing and analysing.

Here we are considering a decade of data for 15 stocks. We considered the data from three countries i.e., South Africa, India, and China. Then we applied the statistical styled facts on the stocks. Then we apply the Markov switching autoregression (MS-AR) model to assess regime changes. Our results help us in identifying the regime changes due to several reasons like outbreak of COVID19, and change in policies within different economies which triggered financial shocks.

The source code provides us with the extraction of the data from yfinance, then we clean the data and apply the statistical styled facts on out data. Latter we visualize the data and use the dash library to interact with the visualization (If your unable to see the graphs in the interactive visualization section, please re-run the code and interact with the graph individually. The reason being the HTML code in the dash library will be over written if we run the interactive visualization section at once).
